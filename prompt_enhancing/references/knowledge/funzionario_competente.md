# Habilitated functionary

A heuristic shared by some contributors of Magoh is that, with the already
registered records in Magoh, all the functionaries in the History of the North
of the Tuscany are known with the municipalities and time periods (in years)
where they were in charge of an intervention.

Therefore, we can infer a very small list of likely functionaries according to
the municipality and the year when the intervention has started. This list will
most of the time be reduced at one person.

For the recent years, this list can be created with scraping on the lists of
the institutional websites:

- [Firenze/Prato/Pistoia](https://soprintendenzafirenze.cultura.gov.it/soprintendenza/territorio-funzionari/)
- [Lucca](https://soprintendenzaluccaemassacarrara.cultura.gov.it/?page_id=188)
- [Pisa/Livorno](https://sabappisalivorno.cultura.gov.it/soprintendenza/territorio-funzionari/)
